    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken parmesan recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223042/chicken-parmesan/">All Recipes</a> is different than most, resulting in a chicken with less sauce and crispier crust. However, this recipe is still easy to follow and extremely tasty.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>Ground pepper</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
      <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup mozzarella</li>
      <li>1/4 cup basil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup provolone cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
      <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
      <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
      <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
