    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (2 pound) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
      <li>1 pound pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
      <li>5 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan; add hash brown potatoes and arrange in an even layer.</li>
      <li>Place sausage and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the sausage is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes; drain.</li>
